I've been thinking for some time to start writing about tech things which I hope others will find my content interesting. For now, this was just an occasion to brush up on my CSS skills, since I haven't followed this space for a long time ( I'm mostly a backend guy, although these days I don't code as much as I would want to).

This site was built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and by design has no javascript. I've tried to keep everything as lightweight as possible so the site loads fast. The result is a static site, built from a template you can find on [my github account](https://github.com/cosminilie/hotex). The CSS used is mostly [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/start) for font icons and [latex css](https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css) for the overall style with some modifications. Over time I want to use this as a refresher project.
